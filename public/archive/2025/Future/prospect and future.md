###  **1. Ion-controlled conformational transformation** 

​	We will explore the precise ionic conditions that regulate the reversible transformation between the planar 2D membrane and the vesicle-like 3D capsule. By systematically adjusting the concentration and species of monovalent cations (K⁺, Na⁺, Li⁺), we aim to construct a phase diagram describing the boundaries between flat, curved, and closed states. High-resolution AFM and cryo-TEM imaging will be employed to monitor the dynamic folding process in real time. These results will deepen our understanding of ion-gated supramolecular mechanics and provide a foundation for designing programmable soft materials.



### **2. Cargo encapsulation and release** 

​	The vesicle-like DNA capsules formed by our system offer natural compartments for molecular encapsulation. We plan to explore the loading of small-molecule drugs, peptides, or fluorescent tracers into the cavity of the capsule during its folding process. By modulating ionic concentration or temperature, we will achieve controlled encapsulation and release of cargo molecules. This strategy opens a pathway toward ion-responsive nanocarriers for precision delivery or localized therapy.

### **3. Mimicking exosome-like communication**

​	Because our DNA vesicles share structural features with natural exosomes, we will investigate their potential as artificial communication units. Functional nucleic acids or aptamers can be displayed on the vesicle surface to recognize specific cell receptors, while the internal space can carry signal molecules or therapeutic oligonucleotides. By combining structural programmability and biological targeting, we aim to simulate exosome-mediated communication and explore applications in synthetic biology and intercellular signaling.

  


### **4. Expanding the design paradigm of DNA materials** 

​	Our work provides a new design strategy that bridges two traditionally separate regimes of DNA nanotechnology — 2D lattices and 3D compartments. In the future, we will further extend this approach to multi-responsive systems (e.g., light, pH, or temperature triggers) to build reconfigurable, adaptive DNA architectures. Ultimately, this research may lead to next-generation smart nanomaterials capable of morphogenesis, molecular communication, and autonomous regulation.
