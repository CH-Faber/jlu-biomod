### **Overview**

​	Our project aims to develop an ion-regulated, self-assembling DNA nanomaterial that can reversibly transform from a planar 2D membrane into a vesicle-like 3D nanostructure, mimicking biological exosomes. This programmable folding behavior introduces new opportunities for molecular delivery and microenvironmental regulation but also raises ethical, legal, and social considerations. The following sections discuss these issues and the measures our team has implemented to ensure responsible research and innovation.



### **1. Ethical Considerations**

**1.1 Research Ethics**

- **Human and Animal Ethics:** Our study involves only synthetic nucleic acid materials and does not use any human or animal subjects.
- **Autonomy and Informed Consent:** Interviews or public engagements conducted for the social section were voluntary and approved by all participants.
- **Data Integrity:** All experimental data are recorded and verified by multiple team members, ensuring reproducibility and transparency.
- **Privacy Protection:** Interview participants’ identities are anonymized, and no personal information is disclosed.

**1.2 Scientific Responsibility**

​	We are committed to transparency and reproducibility in scientific practice. All non-sensitive design sequences and assembly conditions will be made publicly available for academic purposes. The research is conducted under the supervision of qualified faculty and adheres to institutional biosafety regulations.



### **2. Legal and Safety Aspects**

**2.1 Biosafety**

​	Our project involves only non-pathogenic and non-infectious DNA strands. The scaffold strand is a commercially available M13mp18 derivative that poses no biological risk.

- We use non-toxic dyes instead of ethidium bromide for gel electrophoresis.
- The assembly and imaging procedures strictly comply with university safety guidelines, including proper waste disposal for all reagents.
- Any experiments involving heavy metal stains (e.g., uranyl acetate for TEM) are conducted under instructor supervision in designated laboratories.

**2.2 Information and Intellectual Property Security**

- All DNA sequences used are artificial and non-genomic, eliminating concerns about genetic information misuse.
- Design software (e.g., caDNAno, CanDo) is used within its licensing scope, and no patented technology is used without authorization.
- Project data is stored in secure institutional servers with controlled access.

**2.3 Future Clinical and Environmental Impact**

​	Although our current work is purely experimental, potential future applications (e.g., targeted delivery or diagnostic systems) will require strict compliance with **Good Clinical Practice (GCP)** and environmental safety regulations. Any clinical translation must undergo full ethical review and regulatory approval.



### **3. Social Implications**

**3.1 Potential Impact**

​	Our project introduces a new class of biomimetic nanomaterials that combine structural programmability with dynamic behavior. Such materials may benefit:

- **Biomedical research:** as responsive drug carriers or diagnostic platforms;
- **Environmental applications:** as     controllable molecular capture or sensing systems;
- **Education and communication:** by     inspiring new interdisciplinary learning about nanoscience.

**3.2 Public Perception and Responsibility**

​	Public understanding of DNA nanotechnology remains limited. To promote transparency and trust, our team actively communicates scientific principles in accessible language through outreach events and visual demonstrations. We emphasize that our system is **fully synthetic, non-living, and non-genetic**, ensuring it poses no biological threat.

**3.3 Ethical Reflection on Bioinspired Design**

​	By mimicking exosomes, our project draws inspiration from natural biological systems. We recognize that biomimetic technologies can blur boundaries between synthetic and living systems, raising philosophical questions about artificial life and technological responsibility. Our team upholds a strict boundary: our constructs do not replicate or evolve, and their function is purely physicochemical and controllable.



### **4. Conclusion**

​	As controllable DNA nanostructures evolve toward increasing complexity and functionality, new ethical and social responsibilities emerge. Our work demonstrates a commitment to safe, transparent, and ethically grounded research, ensuring that the development of programmable biomimetic materials contributes positively to science and society. We advocate for ongoing interdisciplinary dialogue to anticipate potential consequences and promote responsible innovation in molecular nanotechnology.
